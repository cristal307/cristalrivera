Advanced student of Industrial Production Engineering, with knowledge in quality control, reliability engineering, design of experiments and the study of
new projects to evaluate its feasibility and economic analysis. I have constant desire to be part of new experiences because I know that they
make me grow as a professional and as a person. I love working with multidisciplinary teams so that together we can be part of amazing
discoveries, not only for my own learning but also to contribute to others with my knowledge and to impact society in a positive way.
