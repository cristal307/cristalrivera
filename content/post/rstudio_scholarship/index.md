Before I start writing about my experience about the **Rstudio Scholarship** I want you to know and feel why I am so **grateful and honor** for been part of this experience. I have been using R for three years ago, through this experience of challenges I have grown in a professional and personal way. This time I have known the amazing community of R studio. I remembered the first time Alison Hill commented me a post on LinkedIn haha üòä, I was astonished. I start learning a lot and understanding more about the vision and the purpose of this community.

So, when I saw a tweet with this opportunity which was planned for: *‚Äú70 diversity scholarships available to individuals around the world who are a member of a group that is underrepresented at rstudio::conf(). These groups include people of color, those with disabilities, elders/older adults, LGBTQ folks, and women/minority genders. In past years, we have had to limit our scholarships geographically due to visa issues and we are happy to have no such limitations this year.‚Äù* 



I just knew at that moment that I must tried it, so I fill a form and complete it. Few days after they reach out to me to telling me I was accepted. I can not explain how I felt, mostly because one of my biggest fan- Alison Hill- was giving a workshop.  This scholarship had three components:

<blockquote> 

‚Ä¢	Opportunities for online networking and support before and during the virtual conference

‚Ä¢	Two workshops, taught online the week after rstudio::global(2021) by:

Mine √áetinkaya-Rundel will lead a workshop titled: ‚ÄúWhat they forgot to teach you about teaching R.‚Äù


Alison Hill will lead a workshop on building websites using R Markdown:"Introduce yourself online."


‚Ä¢	Practical support, if needed, to enable participation in the virtual conference (such as an accessibility aid, a resource for internet access, or childcare)

</blockquote>


For the two days of the event I learned a lot and built amazing connections that I really love to keep on my network.  After that I was really motivated on teaching R to others and continue working harder on my personal website- a lot of ideas came to me.

*Thanks R community for letting me have this opportunity and having fun while learning.
