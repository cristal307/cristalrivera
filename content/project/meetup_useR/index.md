Maria Kamenetsky's Abstract: Many learners are often intimidated by entering a statistics or programming course and may even ask for what topics they can review in advance. While recommending textbooks is helpful, learners limited in time may not be able to review that much material. In this talk, I will briefly present the learnr package and how it can be used as a self-assessment tool to help learners efficiently review course material.
